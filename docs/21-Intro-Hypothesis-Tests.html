<p>In a statistical <span style="color:dodgerblue"><strong>hypothesis test</strong></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A researcher wants to determine which of <strong>two competing claims</strong> is more likely true.</li>
<li>Researchers collect data and compare statistics.</li>
<li>Based on data collected, researchers assess which of the two claims seems more likely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples of questions that could be answered using a hypothesis test are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a better method to help smokers quit: give them money for successfully quitting, or penalize them if they don’t stop?</li>
<li>What is the better mailer to send in order to nudge voters into actually voting?</li>
<li>What is a more effective government assistance program, giving people food stamps or cash?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note the difference in the how the statistical question is framed compared to our prior work with estimators and confidence intervals.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confidence intervals</strong> are used to estimate the value of an unknown population parameter.
<ul>
<li>Estimate the difference in two means between two independent treatment groups.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hypothesis tests</strong> are used to gauge competing claims related to an unknown population parameter.
<ul>
<li>Is Treatment A better than Treatment B?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Hypothesis testing provides a statistical framework for analyzing data, determining significance, and ultimately making a decision about the claims.</p>

<h1>Performing a Hypothesis Test</h1>
<hr>
<p>The general process form performing a hypothesis test is informally:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>State the null and alternative hypotheses in terms of population parameter(s).</li>
<li>Collect data from a sample and calculate test statistic(s).</li>
<li>Assess which claim is more likely to be true.</li>
<li>What conclusions (if any) can we make about the two competing claims?</li>
</ol>
<p>We will dive deeper into each step, but for now we take a tour through the process in the context of two different studies. Before considering our first example, we focus on setting up the hypotheses in Step 1.</p>
<section id="stating-the-hypotheses" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stating-the-hypotheses">Stating the Hypotheses</h2>
<hr>
<p>Deciding on a clear and pertinent set of hypotheses is perhaps the most important step in hypothesis testing. Carefully setting up hypotheses helps keep our analysis on track so we achieve our goal.</p>
<section id="the-null-and-alternative-hypotheses" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-null-and-alternative-hypotheses">The Null and Alternative Hypotheses</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>The <span style="color:dodgerblue"><strong>null hypothesis</strong></span> is a “boring” claim. If the null hypothesis is true, this would not really affect or change what is currently believed.</li>
<li>The <span style="color:tomato"><strong>alternative hypothesis</strong></span> is the new or exciting claim a researcher is hoping to establish that is in direct competition with the boring claim in the null hypothesis.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we generally believe coins are “fair” in the sense that when you flip a coin it has a 50% chance of landing on heads and a 50% chance of landing on tails. It would be more interesting if somebody claimed that a coin was not fair.</p>
<section id="two-tailed-tests" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="two-tailed-tests">Two-Tailed Tests</h4>
<hr>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> denote the proportion <strong>of all flips</strong> of a coin that land on heads. If our goal is to show a coin is not fair, without indicating a direction of the bias, we could set up hypotheses</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(p=0.5\)</span>. The coin is fair (boring).</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\({\color{tomato}{p \ne 0.5}}\)</span>. The coin is not fair (what we want to prove).</li>
</ul>
<p>If we claim a coin is not fair <strong>without specifying a direction of the bias</strong>, we use a <span class="math inline">\({\color{tomato}{\ne}}\)</span> sign in <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>, and we say the test is a <span style="color:tomato"><strong>two-tailed test</strong></span>. There are other ways we could claim a coin is biased.</p>
</section>
<section id="one-tailed-tests" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="one-tailed-tests">One-Tailed Tests</h4>
<hr>
<p>A coin might be more biased to land on heads (<span class="math inline">\(p &gt; 0.5\)</span>). A coin might be more biased to land on tails (<span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 0.5\)</span>).</p>
<ul>
<li>If we want to test the claim that a coin is <strong>biased to land on heads</strong>:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(p=0.5\)</span>. The coin is fair (boring).</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\({\color{tomato}{p &gt; 0.5}}\)</span>. The coin is biased to heads (what we want to prove).</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="guidelines-for-stating-hypotheses">Guidelines for Stating Hypotheses</h3>
<hr>
<p>From the examples above, we note some helpful guidelines for setting up hypotheses:</p>
<ul>
<li>We state hypotheses <strong>both in words and using mathematical notation</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Clearly stating the hypothesis in words will help us interpret results.</li>
<li>Using appropriate mathematical notation will help guide our statistical analysis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The hypotheses must be <strong>competing claims</strong>.</li>
<li>Be sure to clearly indicate the <strong>population of interest</strong>.</li>
<li>When using notation to state the hypotheses:
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>population parameters</strong> such as <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</li>
<li>Do not state hypotheses using statistics such as <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>.</li>
<li>We always use an <span style="color:dodgerblue">equality sign, <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span>, in <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span></span>.</li>
<li>We always use an <span style="color:tomato">inequality sign (<span class="math inline">\(\ne\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>) in <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>.</span></li>

<section id="computing-a-test-statistic" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="computing-a-test-statistic">Computing a Test Statistic</h2>
<hr>
<p>Stating our hypotheses in mathematical notation is extremely helpful in helping us decide which sample statistics will be most helpful in assessing our hypotheses. Essentially, based on the population parameters we use in <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>, we use the corresponding statistic(s) from the sample(s). For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we want to test claims about <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, calculating <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> will be useful.</li>
<li>If we want to test claims about <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 - \mu_2\)</span>, calculating <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2\)</span> will be useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Often we standardize statistics, for example using <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-scores. We will explore this idea more deeply later.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-informal-p" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-informal-p">Assess Which Claim is More Likely</h2>
<hr>
<p>When we set up hypotheses, we use a boring claim for the null hypothesis the that is generally assumed to be true. The alternative hypothesis is a new claim, if true, would cause us to doubt and possibly reject the null claim.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is not to prove anything about the null claim <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Our goal is to show <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span> is very likely true by showing <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is very unlikely to be true.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The logic in hypothesis testing is similar to a proof technique called proof by contradiction.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We assume the boring claim <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is true</strong>.</li>
<li>We hope to prove our assumption is unlikely, and thus the opposite (<span class="math inline">\(H_a)\)</span> is true.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on our test statistic(s) and whether the alternative hypothesis is two-tailed or one-tailed, we assess statistical significance as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <span style="color:tomato">test statistic is likely if <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is true</span>, then we do not have evidence to reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>.
<ul>
<li>The test is <span style="color:tomato"><strong>not statistically significant</strong></span>.</li>
<li>The test is inconclusive.</li>
<li>We neither reject nor accept <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If the <span style="color:mediumseagreen">test statistic is unlikely if <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is true in the direction of the claim in <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span></span>, then we have evidence that refutes <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> and supports <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>.
<ul>
<li>The test is <span style="color:mediumseagreen"><strong>statistically significant</strong></span>.</li>
<li>We reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> and accept <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>What do we mean be “likely” and “unlikely”? We consider the concept informally at first, and we will <a href="#sec-p-formal">explore this concept more deeply later</a> using <span style="color:dodgerblue"><strong>p-values</strong></span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="making-a-conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="making-a-conclusion">Making a Conclusion</h2>
<hr>
<p>In the end, there are two possible results from a hypothesis test. Either:</p>
<ul>
<li>The test <strong>is statistically significant</strong>.
<ul>
<li>We reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>.</li>
<li>We accept the competing claim, <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The test <strong>is not statistically significant</strong>.
<ul>
<li>We fail to reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. We do NOT accept <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>.</li>
<li>The test is inconclusive as far as <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span> is considered,</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We will more formally discuss just how unlikely or likely a sample must be in order to for the result to be statistically significant. Informally, we assume the null hypothesis is true and require <strong>evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{H_0}\)</span> is not true</strong> in order to be convinced we should reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>We do not want different researchers subjectively choosing what “beyond a reasonable doubt” means to them. We hope to control for confounding variables in our studies, and making this decision as objective as possible helps account for potential bias by the researchers. In statistical hypothesis testing, a <span style="color:dodgerblue"><strong>significance level</strong></span> is used to make this decision.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The unscrupulous diner’s dilemma is a problem faced frequently in social settings. When a group of diners jointly enjoys a meal at a restaurant, often an unspoken agreement exists to divide the check equally. A selfish diner could thereby enjoy exceptional dinners at bargain prices.
